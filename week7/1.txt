Databases are organized collections of data that are structured to enable efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information.
## Types of databases

- Relational Databases: Use tables to store data and relationships between data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- NoSQL Databases: Designed for more flexible data models and often used for big data or real-time web applications (e.g., MongoDB).
- Graph Databases: Store data in nodes and edges to represent relationships (e.g., Neo4j).
- Vector Databases: Used in ML to store data in the form of embeddings

MongoDB is a NoSQL Database

NoSQL Properties:
## Properties

-**Schema Flexibility:** NoSQL databases often allow for a flexible schema, meaning you can store data in formats that don't require a fixed structure.
-**Scalability:** Many NoSQL databases are designed to scale out horizontally, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers and handle large volumes of traffic.
