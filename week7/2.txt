## Why should you hash passwords?
Password hashing is a technique used to securely store passwords in a way that makes them difficult to recover or misuse.
Instead of storing the actual password, you store a hashed version of it.
## salt
A popular approach to hashing passwords involves using a hashing algorithm that incorporates a salt—a random value added to the password before hashing. 
This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords.
## bcrypt

**Bcrypt**: It is a cryptographic hashing algorithm designed for securely hashing passwords. Developed by Niels Provos and David Mazières in 1999, 
bcrypt incorporates a salt and is designed to be computationally expensive, making brute-force attacks more difficult.
