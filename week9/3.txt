useState is a Hook that lets you add state to functional components.
It returns an array with the current state and a function to update it.
const [count, setcount] = useState(0); in this count is a state and usestate keep rendering when ever it is updated hence it manipuates dom
if we dont use useeffect when ever there is change in state react rerenders creating flashes in the clock
