# Status codes

HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server to indicate the outcome of a clientâ€™s request. They provide information about the status of the request and the server's response.

## 200 series (Success)

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response

### 300 series (Redirection)

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been moved to a new URL permanently. The client should use the new URL provided in the response.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request. The client can use the cached version.

### 400 series (Client Error)

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires user authentication. The client must provide credentials.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

### 500 series (Server Error)

- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server while acting as a gateway or proxy.

# Body

In HTTP communications, the **body** (or **payload**) refers to the part of an HTTP message that contains the actual data being sent to the server.

It is usually `JSON` data that is transferred to the server.

For example - 
{
    todo: "Go to the gym"
}

# Routes

In the context of HTTP, **routes** are paths or endpoints that define how incoming requests are handled by a server.
Routing is a mechanism used to direct incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate handler functions or resources based on the URL path.
