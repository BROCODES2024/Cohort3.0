Using middleware
Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.

Example: An Amusement park
let there be a ticket purchase store, a ticket checking place and a ride
why cant we combine all of them?
imagine there are three rides then its waste of resources if we create middleware for each ride
thats the reason we seperate them ie ticket purchase store, a ticket checking place can do the job for all the three rides present
