Node.js is an open-source JS runtime  that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server side.
It’s built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Runtime?

The environment where JavaScript code is executed. It could be

1. On the server
2. In the browser 
3. On a small watch

## V8 engine?

The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google.
It is used to execute JavaScript code in various environments, most notably in the Google Chrome web browser.

Mozilla has their own JS engine - **SpiderMonkey**
Safari - **JavaScriptCore**

###
To initialize a Node.js project locally, 
Run the following command - 
npm init -y(creates package.json)
node index.js(runs the code index is name of the file (it can be chetan.js aswell))
###


Bun is faster than Nodejs



###
- Add a `script` in `package.json`

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
```

- Run `npm run start`

###
here script is used to make our work simple like i dont want to remember node index.js than i can give script as npm run start 
if there is start2 (script) then we can say npm run start2

# npm

The full form of **NPM** is **Node Package Manager**. 

It is a package manager for JavaScript, primarily used for managing libraries and dependencies in Node.js projects.
NPM allows developers to easily install, update, and manage packages of reusable code

Uses of npm
Initializing a project:
npm init
​
Running scripts:
npm run test
​
Installing external dependencies:
example:
npm install chalk

# Internal packages

Node.js provides you some `packages` out of the box. Some common ones include

1. fs - Filesystem
2. path - Path related functions
3. http - Create HTTP Servers

### fs package

The fs (Filesystem) package is used to read, write, update contents on the filesystem.

# External packages

These are packages written and maintained by other people. You just use their work in your project.

For example

1. Express
2. chalk

You can read more about them on their `npm page` - 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk

Sometimes they are open source as well -

https://github.com/chalk/chalk



### Semantic Versioning Format

Every external package is updated incrementally. A specific version looks something like follows - 

```jsx
"chalk": "^5.3.0"
```

The format is as follows - `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- MAJOR -  Major version changes indicate significant updates or breaking changes.
- MINOR -  Minor version changes signify the addition of new features or improvements in a backward-compatible manner.
- PATCH - Patch version changes include backward-compatible bug fixes or minor improvements that address issues without adding new features or causing breaking changes.

### Usage in `package.json`

- `“chalk”: “^5.3.0”` - npm will install any version that is compatible with `5.3.0` but less than `6.0.0`. This includes versions like `5.3.1`, `5.4.0`, `5.5.0`, etc.
- `“chalk”: “5.3.0”` - Will install the exact version
- `"chalk": "latest"` - Will install the latest version
