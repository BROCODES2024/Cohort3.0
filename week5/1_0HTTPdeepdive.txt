# Headers

HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent between a `client` (like a web browser) and a `server` in an HTTP request or response. They convey metadata about the request or response, such as content type, auth information etc.

**Common headers**

1. Authorization (Sends the user auth information)
2. Content-Type - Type of information client is sending (json, binary etc)
3. Referer - Which URL is this request coming from

## Request headers

The headers the `client` sends out in the request are known as request headers

## Response headers

The headers that the `server` responds with are known as the response headers.

# Fetch API

There are 2 `high level` ways a browser can send requests to an HTTP server:
1. **From the browser URL (Default GET request):**
    - When you type a URL into the browser’s address bar and press Enter, the browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server. This request is used to retrieve resources like HTML pages, images, or other content.
2. **From an HTML form or JavaScript (Various request types):**
    - **HTML Forms:** When a user submits a form on a webpage, the browser sends an HTTP request based on the form’s `method` attribute, which can be `GET` or `POST`. Forms with `method="POST"` typically send data to the server for processing (e.g., form submissions).
    - **JavaScript (Fetch API):** JavaScript running in the browser can make HTTP requests to a server using APIs the `fetch` API. These requests can be of various types (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.) and are commonly used for asynchronous data retrieval and manipulation (e.g., AJAX requests).

Background request can be made through fetch API
