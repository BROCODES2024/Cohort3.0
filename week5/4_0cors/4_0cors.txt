# cors - Cross origin resource sharing

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
security feature implemented by web browsers that controls how resources on a web server can be requested from another domain. 
It's a crucial mechanism for managing `cross-origin` requests and ensuring secure interactions between `different origins` on the web.

origin here means 
ex: https://google.com
most of the times there will be two servers one for frontend and one for backend
backend example https://api.google.com(has express code in it)
frontend has react code in it
how do we get resource given by backend for frontend?
using fetch or axios

but there is a security vulnerability if i write code as say fetch(api.hdfcbank.com) i get all the bank details 
so to solve these issue backend accept fetch/axios requests only from certain websites they trust
for example api.google.com accept requests only from google.com

so cors is not allowed by default in nodejs
if we want to make it work we use cors middleware 

to make html file look like domain:
create a new folder named public and then move html file into it 
cd public 
and then npx serve in terminal
and click on local link shown in terminal


now when we ren both frontend and backend and the requests wont get accepted by backend stating cors error 
but when we use post this doesnt happen
ie cors happen only in browsers

now how to solve this?
use the cors middle ware
npm i cors
