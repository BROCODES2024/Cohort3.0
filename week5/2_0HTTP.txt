Create an HTTP Server
It should have 4 routes
http://localhost:3000/multiply?a=1&b=2
http://localhost:3000/add?a=1&b=2
http://localhost:3000/divide?a=1&b=2
http://localhost:3000/subtract?a=1&b=2
Inputs given at the end after ? are known as query parameters (usually used in GET requests)
The way to get them in an HTTP route is by extracting them from the req argument (req.query.a , req.query.b)
Steps to follow
Initialize node project
npm init -y
​
Install dependencies
npm install express
​
Create an empty index.js
touch index.js
